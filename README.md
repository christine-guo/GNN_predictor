# Neural Architecture Performance PredictionUsing Graph Neural Networks
===============================================================================

Abstract
-----

In computer vision research, the process of automating ar-chitecture  engineering,  Neural  Architecture  Search  (NAS),  has  gainedsubstantial interest. Due to the high computational costs, most recentapproaches  to  NAS  as  well  as  the  few  available  benchmarks  only  pro-vide limited search spaces. In this paper we propose a surrogate modelfor  neural  architecture  performance  prediction  built  upon  Graph  Neu-ral Networks (GNN). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this surrogatemodel on neural architecture performance prediction for structurally un-known architectures (i.e. zero shot prediction) by evaluating the GNNon several experiments on the NAS-Bench-101 dataset.

Example
------------
The NAS-Bench-101 dataset is split into 70%/20%/10% training-,test- and validation set and can be downloaded [NB-101](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z6gAfdN4GGerhmB_UsLvkrBcIFayV9Me/view?usp=sharing)

Unzip and store all in the folder "data/".
